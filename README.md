# 📒 Binder — A Python Projects Dump

Welcome to **Binder**, typa vault of all my Python creations — from baby scripts to mini-projects. This repo isn’t some polished framework or organized mega-library... it’s just *me*, experimenting and coding stuff that intrigues me, confuses me, or keeps me up at 3am 😭😭

## 📦 What's Inside?

This repo holds all sorts of Python stuff — mostly unorganized (because who has time for structure when you're too busy sleepin'). Expect:

- 🎰 Slot Machine simulator (`Slots_Machine.py`)  
  A fully playable RNG-based gambling game with betting logic, symbols, and spicy spin animation.

- 🏦 Basic Banking Program (`Banking_Program.py`)
  Quite basic program from when I was still learning, allows viewing balance, depoiting and withdrawing balance.

- 🔮 More programs slot..
  Every time I make something cool (or cursed), it ends up here — unless it’s too big, then it gets its own spotlight.

## 🚀 How to Run
