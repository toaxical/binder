# 📒 Binder — A Python Projects Dump

**Binder**, typa vault for some of my Python creations — This repo isn’t some polished framework or organized mega-library.. just random stuff

---

## 📦 What's Inside?

This repo holds all sorts of Python stuff — mostly unorganized (because who has time for structure when you're too busy sleepin'). Expect:

- 🎰 Slot Machine simulator (`Slots_Machine.py`)  
  A fully playable RNG-based gambling game.

- 🏦 Basic Banking Program (`Banking_Program.py`)  
  Quite a basic banking thingy.

- 🔐 Encryption-Decryption Program (`Encryption_Program.py`)  
  Enables you to encrypt text and decrypt it (in the same instance of execution).

- 🔮 More programs slot..  
  Every time I make something cool (or cursed), it ends up here — unless it’s too big, then it gets its own spotlight.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone this repo and just run any `.py` file you’re interested in:

```bash
python filename.py
